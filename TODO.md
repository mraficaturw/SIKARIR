# TODO: Fix Authentication Flow in SIKARIR Project

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Fix LoginController Logic
- [x] Edit `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/LoginController.php`
  - Changed logic: If user is unverified (email_verified_at is null), redirect to `verification.notice` instead of logging out and throwing error.
  - Verified users proceed to welcome.

### 2. Fix RedirectIfAuthenticated Middleware
- [x] Edit `app/Http/Middleware/RedirectIfAuthenticated.php`
  - Added logic: If authenticated but unverified, redirect to `verification.notice`.
  - Keep existing logic for verified users.

### 3. Update Views for Verified-Only Actions
- [x] Edit `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`
  - Changed `@auth('user_accounts')` to `@auth('user_accounts') && auth('user_accounts')->user()->hasVerifiedEmail()` for favorite button.
- [x] Edit `resources/views/job-detail.blade.php`
  - Changed `@auth('user_accounts')` to `@auth('user_accounts') && auth('user_accounts')->user()->hasVerifiedEmail()` for favorite and applied buttons.
- [x] Edit `resources/views/jobs.blade.php`
  - Changed `@auth('user_accounts')` to `@auth('user_accounts') && auth('user_accounts')->user()->hasVerifiedEmail()` for favorite button.

### 4. Fix Email Verification Button Route
- [x] Edit `resources/views/vendor/mail/html/button.blade.php`
  - Changed hardcoded route to use `$url` prop for proper verification link.

### 5. Verify Email Verification Flow
- [x] Confirmed `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/VerificationController.php` correctly fulfills verification and redirects to welcome.
- [x] Confirmed `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisterController.php` logs in user and redirects to `verification.notice`.
- [x] Confirmed routes in `routes/web.php` are correct.

## Summary
All authentication logic has been fixed according to the specified flow:
- Guest: Access to welcome, login, register; cannot favorite or applied jobs.
- Unverified: After login/register, redirected to verify-email page; after verification, authenticated and redirected to welcome.
- Verified: Direct access to welcome after login; can favorite and applied jobs.
